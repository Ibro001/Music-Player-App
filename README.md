# Build and Deploy a Better Spotify 2.0 Clone Music App with React 18! (Tailwind, Shazam, Redux)
![Spotify Clone](https://i.ibb.co/mFh2kGZ/Thumbnail-2.png)
#To recreate this web app on your local machine, follow the steps below:
clone this repo,
extract the folder and open in your editor(e.g vsCode),
run npm install || yarn insall.
I used Rapid api for the shazam core api and geo.ipify.org api to get my location which is used in the AroundYou page so you will have to create your own accounts and get your api key to use.
